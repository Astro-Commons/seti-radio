# seti-radio
Open source/data project exploring the scientific aspect of analyzation of radio signals through the search for extraterrestrial intelligence
This project focuses on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence utilising scientific radio concepts through open access data demonstrating the analyzation of of radio signals to distinguish noise from signals
No official claims are created about extraterrestrial life as this repository states methods rather than official conclusions

## scientific motivation
radio waves travel through vast distances in space and carry information regarding the physical process. The SETI process illustrates the radio signals regarding natural sources such as:
- Narrow Band frequencies
- Varied patterns
- Signals with randomised noises
